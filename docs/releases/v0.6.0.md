# Release Notes: v0.6.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-21

## Highlights

- **Workflow categories**: Deterministic vs self-directed paradigms
- **New workflow types**: chain, scatter, graph (deterministic); crew, swarm, council (self-directed)
- **Collaboration config**: Lead agents, specialists, task queues, consensus rules, channels
- **Message schema**: Inter-agent messaging for self-directed workflows
- **MkDocs documentation**: Full documentation site

## What's New

### Workflow Categories

Two workflow paradigms for different orchestration needs:

| Category | Description | Types |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Deterministic** | Schema controls execution paths | chain, scatter, graph |
| **Self-directed** | Agents decide execution paths | crew, swarm, council |

### Workflow Types

#### Deterministic Workflows

| Type | Pattern | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `chain` | A → B → C | Sequential execution |
| `scatter` | A → [B,C,D] → E | Parallel fan-out/fan-in |
| `graph` | DAG | Dependencies with conditional paths |

#### Self-Directed Workflows

| Type | Pattern | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `crew` | Lead → Specialists | Lead delegates to specialists |
| `swarm` | Shared queue | Agents self-claim from task queue |
| `council` | Peer debate | Consensus through voting |

### Collaboration Config

Configure agent interactions for self-directed workflows:

```json
{
  "collaboration": {
    "lead": "architect",
    "specialists": ["frontend", "backend", "qa"],
    "task_queue": true,
    "consensus": {
      "required_agreement": 0.66,
      "max_rounds": 3,
      "tie_breaker": "lead"
    },
    "channels": [
      {"name": "team", "type": "broadcast", "participants": ["*"]}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Message Schema

New schema for inter-agent messaging:

- `schema/message/message.schema.json`

Message types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `delegate_work` | Lead assigns task to specialist |
| `ask_question` | Request information |
| `share_finding` | Broadcast discovery |
| `request_approval` | Ask lead to approve plan |
| `approval` / `rejection` | Approval responses |
| `challenge` | Dispute another agent's finding |
| `vote` | Cast consensus vote |
| `task_claimed` / `task_completed` | Task lifecycle |
| `shutdown_request` / `shutdown_approved` | Session termination |

### Go SDK (v0.7.0)

- `WorkflowCategory` type with `deterministic` and `self-directed` values
- `WorkflowType` renamed: `chain`, `scatter`, `graph`, `crew`, `swarm`, `council`
- `Team.Collaboration` field for collaboration config
- `Team.SelfClaim` and `Team.PlanApproval` convenience fields
- `Team.Validate()` method for workflow-specific validation
- `Team.WorkflowCategory()`, `IsDeterministic()`, `IsSelfDirected()` methods
- `CollaborationConfig`, `ConsensusRules`, `Channel` types
- `Message` types for inter-agent communication
- QuickTemplate-based rendering (box and narrative formats)

### Documentation

- MkDocs documentation site with Material theme
- Release notes in `docs/releases/`
- Updated schema documentation

## Breaking Changes

### Workflow Type Renames

| v0.5.0 | v0.6.0 |
|--------|--------|
| `sequential` | `chain` |
| `parallel` | `scatter` |
| `dag` | `graph` |
| `orchestrated` | (use `crew` with lead agent) |

## Installation

### Go SDK

```bash
go get github.com/agentplexus/multi-agent-spec/sdk/go@v0.7.0
```

### mas CLI

```bash
go install github.com/agentplexus/multi-agent-spec/cmd/mas@v0.6.0
```

## Migration Guide

### Workflow Types

Update workflow type values in team definitions:

```diff
 {
   "workflow": {
-    "type": "sequential",
+    "type": "chain",
     "steps": [...]
   }
 }
```

### Go SDK

Update workflow type constants:

```diff
- workflow.Type = mas.WorkflowSequential
+ workflow.Type = mas.WorkflowChain

- workflow.Type = mas.WorkflowDAG
+ workflow.Type = mas.WorkflowGraph
```

## Examples

### Crew Workflow

```json
{
  "name": "development-team",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agents": ["architect", "frontend", "backend", "qa"],
  "workflow": {"type": "crew"},
  "collaboration": {
    "lead": "architect",
    "specialists": ["frontend", "backend", "qa"]
  },
  "plan_approval": true
}
```

### Swarm Workflow

```json
{
  "name": "bug-triage",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agents": ["triager-1", "triager-2", "triager-3"],
  "workflow": {"type": "swarm"},
  "collaboration": {
    "task_queue": true
  }
}
```

### Council Workflow

```json
{
  "name": "architecture-review",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agents": ["senior-1", "senior-2", "senior-3"],
  "workflow": {"type": "council"},
  "collaboration": {
    "consensus": {

    }
  }
}
```
